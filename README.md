# The Paradox Python:

## Description
- Learn the latest version of Python i.e Python 3
- Understand & learn each and every Python concept.
- Learn object oriented programming in Python

## Day 0
* Setup project skeleton
## Day 1
### Today's progress
- Learn overview the course , what the lesson will you learn in course ? (Section 1)
- Learn about basic Python (Section 2)
    - Install Python and IDE Pycharm
    - Run python program the first time
    - Learn some other mathematical operations
    in Python

    - Boolean logic in Python
### Thoughts
- Have an overview of the course, what is learned from the course, what the project will do
- Planning Course , extimated Time for learn
- Python has many variations, also known as ways of writing code. We should learn a standard for writing python code, also known as Clean Code Python, which helps me to develop my work.
